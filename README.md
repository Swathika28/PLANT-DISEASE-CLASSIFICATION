# PLANT-DISEASE-CLASSIFICATION
## PROJECT OUTLINE:
Automatic object localization and image classification has been one of the major research areas which is in trend nowadays. As we all know that our national economy is highly dependent on our agricultural productivity. If any negligence in this field may result in serious effects on crops, which directly affects our nation. Every time experts are not available to monitor the crop growth.So developing an automated system for real time disease detection will be very much effective in reducing the time as well as cost for the farmers. Before moving to core model development part, its better to know the basic functionalities/concepts of neural networks, optimization, loss functions and model metrics which are used in this research.

Plant disease management is of paramount importance as it directly influences global food security, economic stability, and environmental health. Effective management practices are essential to safeguard crop yield and quality, ensuring that a growing global population has access to an ample and nutritious food supply. Beyond the agricultural sector, disease management contributes to economic resilience by protecting the livelihoods of farmers and stakeholders. It also addresses environmental concerns, promoting sustainable practices that minimize the impact of chemical treatments on ecosystems. 

## METHODOLOGY:
Classification is the technique of classifying the image into classes. This method only classifies the image, it wonâ€™t detect any object. The task of classifying the digits, classifying cat and dog are some of the examples for classification.

Object detection is the technique of identifying the location of the object present in the image and classify the objects present in that location. The input for object detection model is images with annotation files (bounding box co-ordinate and its class label).The output of the trained object detection model is image enclosed with rectangular boxes along with class label and its confidence. Plant disease detection, fruit counting, face detection are some examples for object detection task.
